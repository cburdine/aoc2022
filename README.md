My solutions to the 2022 Advent of Code Problems.

## How to Run:

Running my solutions requires a python3 interpreter. Input is read through stdin. For example:

```
python3 my_solution.py < b.txt
``

In each day's directory, the files ``a.txt`` correspond to the example inputs, while the files ``b.txt`` are the actual puzzle inputs.
